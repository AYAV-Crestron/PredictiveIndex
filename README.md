Predictive Index Project

Predictive Index
Touch Panel Layout

Logo Screen: Predictive Logo.
Startup Page: User will press “Presentation Button”.
Source Selection Page: Two sources “Front Laptop Connection” and “Side Wall Laptop Connection”.
Main Page: There will be “Program Volume” and “Speech Volume” displayed on the screen.
Bottom Task Bar: Show “Presentation Tab” and “Shutdown Button”.


Hidden Button: There should be a hidden button located in the bottom task bar. This button will allow the tech user to see an additional source labeled “Zoom System”.
There should also be a Tech Page that can only be accessed by the tech user for custom audio and video routing if needed for any custom room setup. Drag and drop layout is fine like other previous projects.
